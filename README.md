# tfjs-lstm-shakespeare

A minified, tutorialized implementation of [@tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs)'s [character sequence prediction model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/lstm-text-generation). This work was originally inspired by Andrej Kaparthy's now infamous article ["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Neural Networks"](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).
